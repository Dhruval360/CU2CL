This software, associated installation scripts, and utility files generated by the software are bound by the LGPLv2.1 License specified in LICENSE. We provide a Virginia Tech-specific preamble as shown below. Stipulations for other licensing arrangements are also noted below. This LICENSE.info document is intended to clarify how we intend the license to apply to CU2CL and included/generated utility files, but not to translated applications themselves.

Interpretation:
Translated software may freely link to CU2CL-generated utility files without itself becoming subject to the LGPLv2.1 license. If modifications are made to the generated utility files, or cu2cl_libTooling.cpp, those modifications are necessarily subject to LPGLv2.1. Any work which directly links cu2cl_libTooling.cpp or the resulting cu2cl-tool binary, or any modified version of either should be interpreted as a "work based on the library".
In summation, for this release the LGPLv2.1 license solely applies to:
install.sh
cu2cl_libTooling.cpp
cu2cl_util.c
cu2cl_util.h
cu2cl_util.cl
